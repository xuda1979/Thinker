# IMO 2025 Problem Solver

A parallel AI agent system for solving International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems using Google's Gemini API.

## Overview

This project consists of two main components:
- `agent.py`: A single AI agent that attempts to solve IMO problems
- `run_parallel.py`: A parallel execution system that runs multiple agents simultaneously

## Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your system
2. **Google Gemini API key** - Get one from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
3. **Required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install requests
   ```

## Setup

1. **Clone or download the project files**
2. **Set up your API key**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the project directory
   - Add your API key: `GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`
   - Or set it as an environment variable: `export GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here`

## Usage

### Single Agent (`agent.py`)

Run a single agent to solve an IMO problem:

```bash
python agent.py problem.txt [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `problem.txt`: Path to the problem statement file (required); imo2025 problems are in `problems`

**Options:**
- `--log LOG_FILE`: Specify a log file for output (default: prints to console)
- `--other_prompts PROMPTS`: Additional prompts separated by commas

**Example:**
```bash
python agent.py imo2025_p1.txt --log agent_output.log
```

### Parallel Execution (`run_parallel.py`)

Run multiple agents in parallel to increase the chance of finding a solution:

```bash
python run_parallel.py problem.txt [options]
```

**Arguments:**
- `problem.txt`: Path to the problem statement file (required)

**Options:**
- `--num-agents N` or `-n N`: Number of parallel agents (default: 10)
- `--log-dir DIR` or `-d DIR`: Directory for log files (default: logs)
- `--timeout SECONDS` or `-t SECONDS`: Timeout per agent in seconds (default: no timeout)
- `--max-workers N` or `-w N`: Maximum worker processes (default: number of agents)
- `--other_prompts PROMPTS` or `-o PROMPTS`: Additional prompts separated by commas

**Examples:**
```bash
# Run 20 agents with 5-minute timeout each
python run_parallel.py imo2025_p1.txt -n 20 -t 300

# Run 5 agents with custom log directory
python run_parallel.py imo2025_p1.txt -n 5 -d my_logs

# Run with additional prompts
python run_parallel.py imo2025_p1.txt -n 15 -o "focus_on_geometry,use_induction"
```

## Problem File Format
See the `problems` folder.

## Output and Logging

### Single Agent
- Output is printed to console by default
- Use `--log` to save output to a file
- The agent will indicate if a complete solution was found

### Parallel Execution
- Each agent creates a separate log file in the specified directory
- Progress is shown in real-time
- Final summary shows:
  - Total execution time
  - Number of successful/failed agents
  - Success rate
  - Which agent found a solution (if any)
  - Location of log files

## Understanding the Output

### Solution Detection
The system looks for the phrase "Found a correct solution in run" to identify successful solutions.

### Agent Behavior
- Agents use Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro model
- Each agent follows a structured approach with multiple attempts
- Solutions are verified for completeness and correctness
- Agents can provide partial solutions if complete solutions aren't found

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Problem Formatting**: Ensure your problem file is clear and well-formatted
2. **Parallel Execution**: Use more agents for harder problems (10-20 agents recommended)
3. **Timeout Settings**: Set reasonable timeouts (you may set no timeout)
4. **API Limits**: Be aware of Google API rate limits and costs
5. **Log Analysis**: Check individual agent logs for detailed reasoning

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**: Ensure your Google API key is properly set
2. **Timeout Issues**: Increase timeout or reduce number of agents
3. **Memory Issues**: Reduce max-workers if running out of memory
4. **No Solutions Found**: Try running more agents or check problem clarity

### Debug Mode
Add verbose logging by modifying the agent code or check individual log files for detailed output.
